Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Web Application
Description

Our application is a secure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system that enables users to protect their accounts with an additional layer of verification beyond a standard username and password.

The purpose of the app is to generate and verify time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) ‚Äî six-digit authentication codes that refresh every 30 seconds ‚Äî providing the same level of security used by systems such as Google Authenticator or Authy.

Users can register with a username and password, receive a unique QR code, and scan it using any standard authenticator app. Once registered, they can log in securely, verify their identity with a 6-digit code, and manage all of their registered tokens from a personal dashboard.

The application was designed to demonstrate how 2FA can be implemented with full-stack web technologies, focusing on security, accessibility, and usability.

It solves several common security challenges:

Many authentication systems rely solely on passwords, which can be compromised.

Users need a simple way to register new 2FA keys for multiple services.

Administrators and developers require a lightweight, open-source, and accessible 2FA framework for educational or small-scale use cases.

Key Features
1. Log In and Registration

Users must create an account before using any features.

Upon registration, a unique TOTP secret is generated for each user.

A scannable QR code is displayed for easy setup with an authenticator app.

During login, users must provide both their credentials and a valid 6-digit authentication code.

2. Home Screen

The home page provides a starting point for login and registration.

Navigation buttons direct users to the login or registration forms.

Once logged in, users are directed to a verification screen to input their current token.

3. Token Management Dashboard

Displays all tokens a user has created or imported.

Each token includes the associated service name and current 6-digit code.

Users can add, delete, import, or export tokens at any time.

An ‚ÄúAdd Token‚Äù page allows users to create a new secret key for a new service.

The dashboard dynamically updates codes every 30 seconds using pyotp.

4. Import and Export Tokens

Users can back up their tokens as a JSON file.

The backup file can be re-imported to restore deleted tokens.

This ensures users can migrate their 2FA configuration between devices.

5. Accessibility (Text-to-Speech)

To improve accessibility, the app uses text-to-speech via pyttsx3.

The system can read authentication codes aloud for users with visual impairments.

6. Multi-Language Support

Full i18n (internationalization) support using Flask-Babel.

Automatically detects user language preference or allows manual selection.

Currently supports English (en) and French (fr).

7. Security

All passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored.

The 6-digit TOTP codes comply with RFC 6238 standards.

User secrets are stored securely in a local SQLite database.

Session-based authentication ensures secure state management.

Instructions
User Flow

Users begin on the Home page and can choose to Login or Register.

During registration, they enter a username and password.

The system generates a new secret key.

A QR code is displayed, which they scan with any authenticator app.

Once registration is complete, users can log in using their credentials.

After successful login, they are prompted to enter the 6-digit code generated by their authenticator.

If the token is valid, the user gains access to their Dashboard.

The dashboard allows users to:

View all their registered tokens

Add new tokens

Delete existing tokens

Import/export backups

Users can also switch between English and French via a language selector in the navigation bar.

For accessibility, whenever a token is successfully verified, the system reads the code aloud using built-in text-to-speech functionality.

Development Requirements

This application is developed entirely in Python (Flask) and uses an SQLite database.
It runs locally for testing and can be deployed to any Python-compatible server.

Technical Requirements

Languages: Python (3.10+)

Frameworks: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Babel

Libraries:

pyotp for generating time-based one-time passwords

bcrypt for password hashing

qrcode and Pillow for QR generation

pyttsx3 for text-to-speech accessibility
